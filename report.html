  <h1>CanCanBook: Interactive Cantonese Learning Web App — Multimedia Project Report</h1>
  <p class="note"><strong>Formatting note:</strong> This document is authored to be displayed or printed using 12-point Times New Roman and single line spacing, per the specification.</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction — State of the Art</h2>
  <p>
    The current state of the art in digital language learning is defined by multimedia experiences that blend
    micro-learning, contextual reading, and lightweight assessment. Successful products use a layered
    multimedia strategy: short drills (for memory retrieval), interactive stories (for contextualized input),
    and playful rewards (for motivation). At the same time, modern e-book experiences have evolved from
    static text to dynamic objects that can speak, highlight, animate, and respond to user input.
  </p>
  <p>
    Three converging trends influence the design of contemporary interactive learning applications. First,
    micro-lesson platforms deliver short, high-frequency practice sessions that reduce cognitive load and
    provide immediate feedback. Second, interactive storybooks integrate vocabulary discovery inside
    narrative, which helps learners attach meaning to expressions and acquire rhythm, tone, and syntax
    through repetition. Third, gamified drills employ XP, streaks, or levels to keep motivation high while
    gradually increasing challenge. These trends are not independent; the most effective systems allow
    learners to move between them without disrupting the learning flow.
  </p>
  <p>
    CanCanBook is positioned in this space as a web-based Cantonese learning application that blends
    word-matching, interactive stories, and quick quizzes. This combination aligns with the modern
    expectation that language-learning products are multimedia: not only text, but a mix of sound, animation,
    and responsive UI feedback. The app leverages browser speech synthesis for Cantonese audio, basic
    animation for progress indicators, and a level/XP system for long-term engagement. In short, the product
    aims to bring the best of mobile micro-learning to a browser-based learning environment while retaining
    a narrative reading component similar to interactive e-books.

  <h2>2. Goal and Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The primary goal of this project is to create an interactive multimedia e-book experience for learning
    Cantonese. The product emphasizes a playful but structured learning pathway where students can
    alternate between short vocabulary exercises, reading narrative stories, and completing quick quizzes.
    The focus is not only on delivering information but also on integrating it into an engaging interface
    that encourages repetition and active recall.
  </p>
  <p>
    From a learning goals perspective, the project has two explicit objectives. First, it should demonstrate
    the ability to evaluate multimedia design patterns and synthesize improvements. This includes identifying
    strengths and weaknesses in existing products and translating those insights into a better interaction
    model. Second, it should demonstrate technical and creative skill in creating multimedia content and
    coordinating multiple elements such as images, audio, and animation to form a coherent user experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    CanCanBook is organized into three core modules. The <strong>Word Matching</strong> module uses Duolingo-style
    cards, requiring learners to match English and Cantonese words while earning XP based on difficulty.
    The <strong>Interactive Stories</strong> module provides dialog-based stories with Cantonese characters, Jyutping
    romanization, English translations, and a per-character audio feature through browser speech synthesis.
    The <strong>Quick Quiz</strong> module provides a single multiple-choice question that reinforces vocabulary and
    idioms, awarding XP and confetti feedback for correct answers. These modules are designed to be
    complementary; learners can use drills for memory, stories for context, and quizzes for retrieval.
  </p>
  <p>
    The platform is implemented as a lightweight PHP/JavaScript web application with a MySQL database.
    It uses a minimalistic UI and clean navigation to make switching between modes frictionless. This fits
    the interactive e-book paradigm because the user always feels like they are “within” the content rather
    than in a separate application layer.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Analysis of Existing Products and Recommendations</h2>
  <p>
    To evaluate the design of CanCanBook, it is useful to analyze similar products that occupy neighboring
    spaces in the language-learning and interactive e-book market. While there are many examples, three
    categories are especially relevant: mobile micro-learning apps, interactive storybook platforms, and
    quiz-centric reinforcement tools. The analysis below compares these categories in relation to learning
    flow, multimedia use, and engagement strategy, and then provides recommendations for improvement in
    the CanCanBook context.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example A: Duolingo-style micro-learning apps.</strong> These products excel at consistency. They encourage
    daily usage through streaks, tiny lessons, and immediate correctness feedback. Their interfaces are
    bright and friendly, and their audio feedback is frequent. However, micro-learning apps sometimes suffer
    from decontextualized vocabulary: learners can recognize a word but may not understand its usage in
    conversation. Their story modes are usually secondary and often hidden behind progression gates.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example B: Interactive storybook platforms.</strong> This category includes web or tablet products that embed
    dictionary lookups, read-aloud features, and clickable vocabulary inside narrative passages. These
    platforms are excellent for contextualized learning. But they can be weaker in providing spaced
    repetition and fast feedback loops, so the learner might enjoy a story but not retain words without
    external repetition.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example C: Quiz and flashcard systems.</strong> Tools like flashcards or quick quizzes are effective for
    retrieval practice and often allow personalized review. They can be flexible, but they can also feel
    repetitive and disconnected from a storyline. Motivation tends to drop over time unless paired with
    a narrative or achievement system.
  </p>
  <p>
    CanCanBook already integrates the core strengths of all three categories: it offers micro-learning
    (word matching), contextual reading (interactive stories), and quick assessment (quiz). However, an
    evaluation reveals several opportunities for design refinement:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Recommendation 1: Story-based progression.</strong> Instead of treating modules as parallel paths,
      a narrative progression could sequence vocabulary practice before story chapters and then follow with
      a quiz checkpoint. This will connect drills to context and deepen retention.</li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation 2: Adaptive difficulty cues.</strong> Provide visual indicators that show which vocabulary
      or story levels are most relevant to a learner’s current XP or proficiency. This reduces choice overload
      and guides the learner to appropriate content.</li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation 3: Richer audio scaffolding.</strong> The current speech synthesis works well for
      pronunciation, but additional options such as slow/normal playback or tone highlighting would further
      support Cantonese learners.</li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation 4: Post-story reflection.</strong> After finishing a story, a short reflective prompt or
      summary quiz could reinforce key vocabulary and encourage recall.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These recommendations emphasize the importance of integrating the modules into a coherent learning
    journey rather than leaving them fully optional. While flexibility is important, the overall experience
    can be improved by offering guided paths and meta-structure.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Implementation — Development Process and Multimedia Production</h2>
  <p>
    Developing CanCanBook required a multimedia pipeline that integrates text, audio, and interaction logic.
    The work can be divided into four phases: pre-production planning, media asset creation, authoring and
    coding, and integration/testing. The following sections describe each phase in detail.
  </p>

  <h3>4.1 Pre-Production Planning</h3>
  <p>
    Pre-production involved defining learning outcomes, creating a content outline, and mapping the
    interactive flow. In practice, this meant selecting vocabulary sets for different difficulty levels,
    identifying appropriate story themes, and designing quiz questions that aligned with both the vocabulary
    and the narrative context. The planning stage also determined the system architecture: a lightweight PHP
    backend paired with a JavaScript-driven front end for interaction.
  </p>
  <p>
    The pre-production checklist included:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Defining the target learner profile (beginner to intermediate Cantonese learners).</li>
    <li>Establishing the three core modes and the XP-based progression system.</li>
    <li>Creating data structures for vocabulary lists, story JSON, and quiz items.</li>
    <li>Planning UI wireframes for each screen, especially the story view and matching cards.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A key planning decision was to rely on web-native features (like the Web Speech API) rather than
    pre-recorded audio. This kept costs low while still providing pronunciation guidance. Another decision
    was to prioritize clarity over animation-heavy design, since this is an educational product and must
    remain readable and accessible.
  </p>

  <h3>4.2 Multimedia Element Creation</h3>
  <p>
    The project uses multiple media types, each selected to reinforce learning outcomes. The most
    prominent elements are text (characters, romanization, translation), audio (speech synthesis),
    animation (progress updates and confetti), and UI graphics (cards, buttons, icons). Although there
    are no high-resolution photographic assets, the integration of these elements qualifies as an
    interactive multimedia system.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Text elements:</strong> Cantonese characters and Jyutping are displayed in a layered manner to support
    phonetic decoding. English translations are placed at the line level to avoid clutter and preserve
    reading flow. Typography choices emphasize legibility, with a clear hierarchy between character and
    romanization lines.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Audio elements:</strong> The Web Speech API provides on-demand audio with the “Play Audio” function.
    This is generated dynamically rather than pre-recorded, enabling quick iteration and a lighter
    asset footprint. Audio feedback in the word-matching and quiz modules reinforces correct answers
    and encourages immediate repetition.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Animation elements:</strong> The progress bar in word matching and the confetti animation in quizzes
    serve as low-cost but effective feedback. These small visual cues increase engagement without
    overwhelming the learning experience.
  </p>

  <h3>4.3 Authoring and Integration</h3>
  <p>
    Authoring involved assembling the data (vocabulary, stories, quiz questions) into a structured database
    and building the interface logic in PHP and JavaScript. Stories were authored in JSON format to allow
    per-line segmentation and word-level interaction. Vocabulary and quiz questions were stored in tables
    keyed by level, enabling dynamic retrieval based on learner proficiency.
  </p>
  <p>
    The integration phase focused on ensuring a consistent user experience across modules. Shared UI
    components such as the navigation bar, level indicator, and XP counters create continuity. Data flow
    was designed so that each module can update the user’s progress in the same way. This consistency is
    critical for user trust because it reinforces the idea that all activities contribute to the same
    learning journey.
  </p>

  <h3>4.4 Planning and Costing</h3>
  <p>
    A small-scale web app like CanCanBook can be produced with minimal external cost if open-source
    libraries and browser APIs are leveraged. Below is a typical cost estimate for a student-scale project,
    assuming a single developer and a limited production window.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Labor time:</strong> 80–120 hours total, including content authoring, coding, and testing.</li>
    <li><strong>Software:</strong> $0 (using open-source tools, browser APIs, and free development environments).</li>
    <li><strong>Hosting:</strong> $5–10/month for a small shared hosting plan or student web server.</li>
    <li><strong>Audio production:</strong> $0 if using speech synthesis; $100–300 if hiring voice actors.</li>
    <li><strong>Visual assets:</strong> $0 if created in-house using vector tools; higher if professional design is required.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Costing shows that a multimedia application with meaningful interaction can be built affordably when
    the system architecture is lightweight and relies on the browser for multimedia playback.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Logical Designs — Functional Flow and Control Requirements</h2>
  <p>
    Logical design defines how information is structured and how user actions flow through the system. For
    a multimedia application, it is especially important to map how media elements respond to user input
    and how feedback is provided. CanCanBook is structured around a hub-and-spoke model: users arrive at
    a dashboard, select a module, complete a task, and return with updated XP. The flow is intentionally
    simple so that cognitive energy is spent on language learning rather than navigation.
  </p>

  <h3>5.1 Functional Overview</h3>
  <p>
    The main functional components include: authentication, the home dashboard, word matching, interactive
    stories, quick quizzes, and progression tracking. Each component is a self-contained screen, but all
    share common navigation elements and consistent visual cues.
  </p>

  <h3>5.2 Control Requirements by Screen</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Login Screen:</strong> A single “Continue with Google” button. This reduces friction and ensures
      account data is consistent. The control requirement is minimal to keep attention on learning.</li>
    <li><strong>Home Dashboard:</strong> Buttons or cards that link to Word Matching, Stories, and Quiz. A level/XP
      indicator must remain visible. The user should have a clear understanding of progress and next steps.</li>
    <li><strong>Word Matching Screen:</strong> Interactive cards that can be clicked or tapped. Controls include
      “Start,” “Reset,” and a toggle for hiding Cantonese text (listening mode). The system must provide
      immediate correctness feedback and update the progress bar.</li>
    <li><strong>Story Screen:</strong> Controls include “Play Audio” per line and optional per-character playback.
      A “Next” or “Back” navigation path allows movement between stories. A return-to-dashboard control
      should be present to allow quick switching.</li>
    <li><strong>Quick Quiz Screen:</strong> Multiple-choice options with a single submit action. After submission,
      the interface must show correct/incorrect feedback and update XP if correct. A “Next Question” or
      “Try Another” button supports continuous practice.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The logical flow is summarized in Figure 2. It shows that each module feeds into the same XP update
    system. This is important because it enables a unified progression model while allowing the learner to
    choose different types of multimedia interaction.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Storyboarding and UI Design</h2>
  <p>
    Storyboarding is essential in multimedia production because it visualizes not only content but also
    pacing and user interaction. For CanCanBook, the storyboard focuses on the learner journey: entering
    the system, selecting a module, engaging with media, and receiving feedback. The storyboard below
    is a simplified representation of the user flow with emphasis on the story-reading path.
  </p>

    <figcaption>Figure 3. Simplified storyboard that illustrates the main screens from entry to XP completion.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h3>6.1 User Interface Design Principles</h3>
  <p>
    The UI is designed around clarity and consistency. Learners must be able to focus on reading and
    listening without navigation distractions. The layout follows a simple hierarchy: top navigation with
    user and progress indicators, main content area for stories or cards, and a supportive footer or action
    buttons. The typography is chosen to make Cantonese characters large and legible, while the romanized
    Jyutping remains directly above the characters for quick reference. English translations are placed
    below to reduce crowding.
  </p>
  <p>
    Color usage is minimal: neutral backgrounds with accent colors for actions and feedback. This aligns
    with a calm learning environment and avoids visual overload. Icons are used sparingly to represent
    audio, progression, and navigation. The iconography is intentionally simple to reduce cultural
    ambiguity and to keep the interface accessible to learners of all ages.
  </p>

  <h3>6.2 Screen-by-Screen UI Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Landing/Home:</strong> The landing page uses a clean hero section with a focus on the primary
      call-to-action. The dashboard presents three large cards or buttons to select a learning mode.</li>
    <li><strong>Word Matching:</strong> The card layout highlights two languages with balanced typography. The
      progress bar is anchored at the top to show completion at a glance.</li>
    <li><strong>Stories:</strong> The story view is designed like an e-book page: lines are separated with
      generous spacing, and the “Play Audio” control is aligned to the right to signal action without
      interrupting reading flow.</li>
    <li><strong>Quiz:</strong> The quiz screen uses a single-question focus, large option buttons, and an
      immediate feedback area. Confetti appears briefly, then the interface resets to keep pace.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Testing and Evaluation — Alpha and Beta</h2>
  <p>
    Testing was structured into two stages: Alpha testing for internal correctness and usability, and Beta
    testing for external feedback and learning effectiveness. Each stage included both functional and
    qualitative evaluation.
  </p>

  <h3>7.1 Alpha Testing</h3>
  <p>
    Alpha testing focused on verifying that each module works as designed. Specific checks included:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Google login correctly creates or retrieves a user profile and initializes
      level/XP values.</li>
    <li><strong>Word Matching:</strong> Cards shuffle correctly, matches register, progress bar fills, and XP is
      awarded based on level.</li>
    <li><strong>Stories:</strong> JSON story content loads properly, character-level clicks trigger speech synthesis,
      and line-level “Play Audio” works with the correct text.</li>
    <li><strong>Quiz:</strong> Options render from the database, correct answers trigger feedback and XP, and
      incorrect answers show error states without XP reward.</li>
    <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Users can return to the dashboard without losing session state, and the
      level/XP display remains accurate.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Alpha testing also checked for edge cases such as missing audio voices in the browser or incomplete
    story data. The conclusion was that the overall logic is stable, but it would be beneficial to provide
    graceful fallback messaging when a device does not support Cantonese speech synthesis.
  </p>

  <h3>7.2 Beta Testing</h3>
  <p>
    Beta testing targeted real user feedback with a small group of Cantonese learners. The evaluation
    criteria were usability, engagement, and perceived learning value. Users reported that the story module
    was the most enjoyable due to its narrative structure, while the word-matching module was perceived as
    the most effective for memorization. The quiz module was seen as a quick confidence check.
  </p>
  <p>
    Feedback also revealed improvement opportunities. Some users wanted audio repetition controls to slow
    down playback. Others suggested a way to bookmark story lines or words for later review. Several users
    asked for clearer cues about which activity to do next. These points align with the recommendations in
    Section 3 and suggest that guided progression and richer audio controls would be the most valuable
    next steps.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    CanCanBook demonstrates a practical application of multimedia learning principles in a web-based
    environment. By combining vocabulary drills, interactive stories, and quick quizzes, it bridges
    the gap between decontextualized practice and contextual reading. Its multimedia elements—text,
    audio, and animation—are integrated thoughtfully to support both engagement and learning outcomes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The analysis of existing products shows that the project is well aligned with the state of the art,
    but it can be improved by deepening narrative progression, adding adaptive guidance, and enhancing
    audio scaffolding. These improvements would strengthen the connection between activities and make
    the learning journey more cohesive. Overall, the project fulfills the goals of evaluating multimedia
    design, creating interactive content, and demonstrating technical skills in authoring an e-book-like
    experience for Cantonese learners.
